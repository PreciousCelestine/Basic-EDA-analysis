##  EDA Process Breakdown

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
- Load the CSV dataset using `pandas`
- View sample records (`head()`/`tail()`)
- Check dataset dimensions, data types, and column names
- Investigate null values and anomalies

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using visual heatmaps
- Replaced erroneous data like negative `Membership Years`
- Converted problematic entries with statistical replacements (e.g., mean)
